## Methodology

Currently, it is not possible to run benchmarking tests on the CI, since it
requires a full node with the account descriptors imported in the bitcoind
wallet. I used [this script](tests/integration/sync.sh) for the benchmarks,
but the process is still very manual. If you have ideas on improving this,
let's talk!


‚ö†Ô∏è These benchmarks should not be taken at face value. The synchronization
time also has a lot to do with the number of UTXOs, which is not reflected
below.

There are a lot of ways to improve the performance, although **RPC Batch**
and/or **Goroutines** are probably going to have the biggest impact.

### Synchronization

##### Legend

* **Ops** = Number of operations (`libcore` abstraction for transactions)
* **LBE** = Ledger Blockchain Explorer
* **LSS** = Ledger Sat Stack
* **reset** = reset libcore DB and sync from scratch
